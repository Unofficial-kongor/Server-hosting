# System and infrastructure requirements

Each server instance requires 1 core at at least 1.7 ghz and between 500-800 mb of ram with a **STR** *(Single Thread Rating)* of 1250. However its **recommended **to do 1.5-2 cores for every game server.


**Example: ** 8 game servers * 1.5 cores = 12 cpu cores*

### CPUs confirmed working with # instances

| CPU                    | Speed             | Cores | Threads | # Instances confirmed | STR  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- |:-----:|:-------:|:---------------------:|:----:|
| Ryzen 5600x            | 3.7 GHz (4.6 GHz) | 6     | 12      | 12                    | 3355 |

### Is your CPU not confirmed?

If the CPU isnt confirmed. You can confirm it by

1. Go to https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php and search for the CPU that is going to host the server
2. Make sure the _"Single Thread Rating"_ is above 1250. 
3. Report to tarrexd or kladze what your min max is
