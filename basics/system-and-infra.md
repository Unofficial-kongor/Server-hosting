# System and infrastructure requirements

1. Go to https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php and search for the CPU that is going to host the server
2. Make sure the _"Single Thread Rating"_ is above 1250. Otherwise the server might lag

* Each "server instance" you wish to host, requires
  * 1 core and @ 1.8ghz
  * 500-800 MB ram
