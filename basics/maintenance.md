# Maintenance

There is two ways to perform maintenance

1. Close all windows like a maniac, risking your reputation.
2. Gracefully shutting down by typing `managerStartShutdown` in the `K2 Server Manager` window. This will close all servers when they are not busy anymore

After you are done with updates you can openand run `C:\Heroes of Newerth\compel.exe` with *administrator rights*
