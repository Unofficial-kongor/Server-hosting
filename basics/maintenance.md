# Maintenance

There is two ways to peform maintenance

1. Close all windows like a maniac, risking your reputaion.
2. Gracefully shutting down by typing `managerStartShutdown` in the `K2 Server Manager` window. This will close all servers when they are not busy anymore

After you are done with updates you can open CMD as admin and run `C:\H O N\compel.exe`
