# Testing server

Before we rush out as many instances as possible we need to make sure the server is works and is stable enough to play on

1. Navigate to your hon folder etc `c:\Heroes of Newerth`
2. start`compel.exe`with *administrator rights*
3. Within seconds two windows should appear. one Named `K2 Manager` and a console-version of HON named `YourServerName - 1` also the CMD-window should now be renamed to `HonProxy` the `YourServerName - 1` will load a bunch of resources, in a short while it will stop load and the `K2 Manager` will tell you the server is up and running
4. Start hon and create a test game. Create a public game with *bots / no stats* and manually select your own server![]()
   If you succeded all stepts. You are good to go!
