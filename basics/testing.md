# Testing server

Before we rush out as many instances as possible we need to make sure the server is works and is stable enough to play on

1. open CMD as administrator and `cd` into `c:\H O N`
2. type `compel.exe`and hit enter. 
3. Within seconds two windows should appear. one Named `K2 Manager` and a console-version of HON named `YourServerName - 1` also the CMD-window should now be renamed to `HonProxy` the `YourServerName - 1` will load a bunch of resources, in a short while it will stop load and the `K2 Manager` will tell you the server is up and running
4. Start hon and look for your server under _Hosted Games_ -> _Create Game_ -> _Select Server_
5. Start a game and finish it (requires at least 1 more player)
6. After the game is finished, wait a couple of minutes and Request the replay and play it.

If you succeded all stepts. You are good to go!
